      <li>Help carry filming equipment and support the videographer as needed</li>
      <li>Participate in pre-filming planning, social media promotion, and on-location interviews</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧰 Requirements</h2>

      <li>Excellent communication and articulation skills</li>
      <li>Strong on-camera presence (no prior presenting experience required)</li>
      <li>Confident interacting with the public and business owners</li>
      <li>Passion for travel, the outdoors, and showcasing Australia’s beauty</li>
      <li>Relatively fit and active</li>
      <li>Comfortable being away from home for up to 10 months per year</li>
      <li>Full driver’s licence and willingness to share driving duties</li>
      <li>Comfortable sharing accommodation (separate beds usually, but not guaranteed depending on location)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⭐ Bonus Skills (Preferred but Not Essential)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Videography or professional video-editing experience</li>
